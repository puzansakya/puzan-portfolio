You can access the default Nginx landing page to confirm that the software is running properly by navigating to your server’s IP address. If you do not know your server’s IP address, you can get it a few different ways.

```bash
ip addr show eth0 | grep inet | awk '{ print $2; }' | sed 's/\/.*$//'
```

<br />

You will get back a few lines. You can try each in your web browser to see if they work.

An alternative is typing this, which should give you your public IP address as seen from another location on the internet:

```bash
curl -4 icanhazip.com
```

<br />

# **Managing the Nginx Process**

<br />

Now that you have your web server up and running, let’s review some basic management commands.

<br />

To stop your web server, type:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop nginx
```
<br />

To start the web server when it is stopped, type:

```bash
sudo systemctl start nginx
```
<br />

To stop and then start the service again, type:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```
<br />

If you are simply making configuration changes, Nginx can often reload without dropping connections. To do this, type:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```
<br />

By default, Nginx is configured to start automatically when the server boots. If this is not what you want, you can disable this behavior by typing:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable nginx
```
<br />

To re-enable the service to start up at boot, you can type:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

<br />

# In most cases, administrators will remove this file from sites-enabled/ and
# leave it as reference inside of sites-available where it will continue to be
# updated by the nginx packaging team.

# This file will automatically load configuration files provided by other
# applications, such as Drupal or Wordpress. These applications will be made
# available underneath a path with that package name, such as /drupal8.
